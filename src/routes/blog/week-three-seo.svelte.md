## Traditional SEO Strategies

Traversal through crawlers. 

**Page Rank:**
It's about your trust factor to a specific topic. 

So if your page is known for both coffee and law, and you get links on mostly coffee shops, you're not going to get much trust in the law side. 

Linking to your own page makes your topigraphy more enriched. 

**Long Tail Keywords**

It's cheaper, and more focused. But you'll have to buy 1000+ keywords to make it work.
Words that are relevant to your business.


**Instructor: Why is car donation so high?**
Key words were at $70. 
Because car donations gave you tax breaks at roughly $1200. 


**Link Building Campaign**
Create 'key pages' for popular products & services.
Like, for Frontendmasters -> Create Junior/Intermediate/Professional tiers.
Because new courses will always exist, but those keys will always be forever.


**White Hat SEO VS Black Hat SEO**
JC Penney a few years ago hired a black hat SEO who crushed their ranking from page 1 to page 8.

> If you own a Web site, for instance, about Chinese cooking, your site’s Google ranking will improve as other sites link to it. The more links to your site, especially those from other Chinese cooking-related sites, the higher your ranking. In a way, what Google is measuring is your site’s popularity by polling the best-informed online fans of Chinese cooking and counting their links to your site as votes of approval.

> But even links that have nothing to do with Chinese cooking can bolster your profile if your site is barnacled with enough of them. And here’s where the strategy that aided Penney comes in. Someone paid to have thousands of links placed on hundreds of sites scattered around the Web, all of which lead directly to JCPenney.com.

> At 7 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, J. C. Penney was still the No. 1 result for “Samsonite carry on luggage.”
> Two hours later, it was at No. 71.

> At 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Penney was No. 1 in searches for “living room furniture.”
> By 9 p.m., it had sunk to No. 68.

**Removing Bad links**
Will be penalized.
Remove link reference from spammy websites.
Using Google Disavow Tools. 
Elmininate mutual 'link exchange' with other sites.


**Ad Campaigns Pricing**

For apps, there's CPI - cost per install. 
You add a callback after the install is finished.



**Basic Metadata**
Keywords don't matter anymore.

## Social Metadata

**Facebook OpenGraph**
`<meta property="og:url" content="http://www.nytimes...">`

Known as a conanical URL
usually the desktop version
no sessions

The content gives special unique features to the post on Facebook.

Open Graph is becoming more common. 

## Structured Data

This is metadata in the html email.

With metadata, you can control the breadcrumb list. 


## Mobile Optimizations

Google forked their search index. 
For mobile-specific index versus everything else. 
So you get different search results.


**Viewport**
Make sure your viewports are correct.

**manifest.json**

It's a json of special things
192x size of android
512x size for android start screen

theme_color is the color of the app. 


## Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project

AMP keeps third-party JS off the critial path.

Copy paste a specific meta tag.
Img tag doesn't work for AMP.
Styles are also custom using inline.
