## Debugging Javascript

Random shit:

```js

'ðŸ’©'.length // 2 because it's unicode counting

0.1 + 0.2 // JS floating point operations have issues with overflow rounding percision

new Date(2016, 5, 31); // 2016 July 1 -- this is saying June 31st, which doesn't exist... which overflows to July 1.

new Array(0, 1, Array(2)); // [0, 1, [undefined, undefined]]

[10, 5, 1].sort(); // [1, 10, 5] because it treats it as strings
```
