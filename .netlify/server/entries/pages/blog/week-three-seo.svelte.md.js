<p>Traversal through crawlers. </p>
<p><strong>Page Rank:</strong>
It\u2019s about your trust factor to a specific topic. </p>
<p>So if your page is known for both coffee and law, and you get links on mostly coffee shops, you\u2019re not going to get much trust in the law side. </p>
<p>Linking to your own page makes your topigraphy more enriched. </p>
<figure><img src="${"https://i.imgur.com/lC18GRn.png"}"></figure>
<p>It\u2019s cheaper, and more focused. But you\u2019ll have to buy 1000+ keywords to make it work.
Words that are relevant to your business.</p>
<p><strong>Instructor: Why is car donation so high?</strong>
Key words were at $70.
Because car donations gave you tax breaks at roughly $1200. </p>
<p><strong>Link Building Campaign</strong>
Create \u2018key pages\u2019 for popular products &amp; services.
Like, for Frontendmasters -&gt; Create Junior/Intermediate/Professional tiers.
Because new courses will always exist, but those keys will always be forever.</p>
<p><strong>White Hat SEO VS Black Hat SEO</strong>
JC Penney a few years ago hired a black hat SEO who crushed their ranking from page 1 to page 8.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you own a Web site, for instance, about Chinese cooking, your site\u2019s Google ranking will improve as other sites link to it. The more links to your site, especially those from other Chinese cooking-related sites, the higher your ranking. In a way, what Google is measuring is your site\u2019s popularity by polling the best-informed online fans of Chinese cooking and counting their links to your site as votes of approval.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But even links that have nothing to do with Chinese cooking can bolster your profile if your site is barnacled with enough of them. And here\u2019s where the strategy that aided Penney comes in. Someone paid to have thousands of links placed on hundreds of sites scattered around the Web, all of which lead directly to JCPenney.com.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At 7 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, J. C. Penney was still the No. 1 result for \u201CSamsonite carry on luggage.\u201D
Two hours later, it was at No. 71.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Penney was No. 1 in searches for \u201Cliving room furniture.\u201D
By 9 p.m., it had sunk to No. 68.</p></blockquote>
